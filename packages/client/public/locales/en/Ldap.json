  "LdapIntro": "LDAP is a way to import users and groups from an LDAP server, as well as provide user authentication on the portal using logins/passwords stored on the LDAP server. Users will be imported immediately after the settings are saved. Users added later will be imported during their first authentication on the portal.",

  "LdapToggleDescription": "Enable this option if you want to add users from LDAP server/Active Directory to DocSpace automatically. The added users will be able to authorize using their LDAP server/Active Directory credentials. DocSpace does not save the user passwords locally and will authenticate users sending their login and password to LDAP server/Active Directory.",
  "LdapDisclaimer": "Please, keep in mind: the portal user email will be taken from the 'Mail Attribute' setting. If it is missing, it will be formed in the following way: 'Login Attribute + @ + LDAP Domain'. In case such an email does not exist, the user will not receive any portal notification.",
